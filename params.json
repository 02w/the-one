{"name":"The ONE","tagline":"The Opportunistic Network Environment simulator","body":"### Information\r\n\r\nThe ONE is a simulation environment that is capable of\r\n\r\n* generating node movement using different movement models\r\n* routing messages between nodes with various DTN routing algorithms and sender and receiver types\r\n* visualizing both mobility and message passing in real time in its graphical user interface.\r\n* ONE can import mobility data from real-world traces or other mobility generators. It can also produce a variety of reports from node movement to message passing and general statistics.\r\n\r\nThe ONE simulator was developed at Aalto University and is now maintained and extended in cooperation between Aalto University (Comnet) and Technische Universität München (Connected Mobility).\r\n\r\nDevelopers: [Ari Keränen](https://twitter.com/ari_kk), Teemu Kärkkäinen, Mikko Pitkänen, Frans Ekman, Jouni Karvo, and Jörg Ott \r\n\r\n### Acknowledgments\r\n\r\nThe ONE simulator has been developed in the SINDTN and CATDTN projects supported by Nokia Research Center (Finland), in the TEKES ICT-SHOK Future Internet and IoT-SHOK projects, Academy of Finland projects RESMAN and Picking Digital Pockets (PDP), European Community's Seventh Framework Programme SCAMPI project, and supported by EIT ICT Labs.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Releases\r\n\r\nThe latest release:\r\n* [The ONE v1.6.0](https://github.com/akeranen/the-one/tree/v1.6.0)\r\n\r\nPrevious releases:\r\n* [The ONE v.1.5.1-RC2](https://www.netlab.tkk.fi/tutkimus/dtn/theone/down/one_1.5.1-RC2.zip)\r\n* [The ONE v.1.4.1](https://www.netlab.tkk.fi/tutkimus/dtn/theone/down/one_1.4.1.zip)\r\n\r\nOlder versions of the ONE are available from the [old ONE homepage](https://www.netlab.tkk.fi/tutkimus/dtn/theone/).\r\n\r\n### Referring to the ONE simulator\r\n\r\nIf you have used the ONE simulator in your research, please use the SIMUTools paper ([[PDF]](https://www.netlab.tkk.fi/tutkimus/dtn/theone/pub/the_one_simutools.pdf) [[BibTeX]](https://www.netlab.tkk.fi/tutkimus/dtn/theone/pub/theone_bib.txt)) as the reference.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Community Resources\r\n\r\nThe users of the ONE simulator have created many helpful resources:\r\n\r\n* [Delay-Tolerant Blogging by Juliano Fischer Naves](http://www.delaytolerantnetworks.com/)\r\n* [Barun Saha's Knowledge Base for the ONE](https://theonekb-barunsaha.rhcloud.com/)\r\n* [The ONE Simulator for Beginners](http://one-simuator-for-beginners.blogspot.in/2013/08/one-simulator-introduction.html)\r\n* [ONE Tutorial by Mauro Margalho Coutinho](http://www.margalho.pro.br/subsites/theone.html)\r\n* [Agussalim's metrics compilation](http://agoes.web.id/metric-description-from-simulator/)\r\n* [Barun Saha's blog on Delay-tolerant Networks](http://delay-tolerant-networks.blogspot.com.br/)\r\n* [Sahil Gupta's web site related to DTN and ONE](https://sites.google.com/site/sahilgupta221231/file-cabinet)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Contact\r\n\r\nFor questions about the simulator you can subscribe to the ONE user community email list at our [mailman](https://www.netlab.tkk.fi/mailman/listinfo/theone).\r\n\r\nThis list is for discussion and announcements for the ONE simulator. The users of the ONE can report bugs, share experiences and code, and give hints to each other on this list. New releases of the ONE are also announced on this list.\r\n\r\nHowever, we are planning to move to a new platform for Q&A in the near future. Stay tuned, the change will be announced at the mailing list.\r\n\r\n\r\n### License\r\n\r\nThe program is released under GPLv3 license. Copyrights of the included map data of Helsinki downtown are owned by Maanmittauslaitos.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Running (a really quick help)\r\n\r\nDownload the program. Compile it using your favourite IDE or `compile.bat` (on Windows) or `compile.sh` (on Linux or Mac OS X).\r\n\r\nStart a simulation by typing in (Linux/Unix/OS X) terminal:\r\n\r\n    ./one.sh\r\n\r\nor (in Windows):\r\n\r\n    one.bat\r\n\r\nAfter a short while, the GUI should start and a simulation based on default settings should be up and running.\r\n\r\nEvery simulation run uses the settings from default_settings.txt, if one exists. You can give an additional configuration file(s) as a parameters to define new settings or override the ones defined in default settings. For example:\r\n\r\n    ./one.sh example_settings/snw_settings.txt\r\n\r\nThat would use the (included) snw_settings.txt settings configuration file and change the router for all nodes to Spray and Wait (default is \"passive router\", i.e., no routing logic). See default_settings.txt for information about the different settings.\r\n\r\nIf you don't wish to use the GUI, you can run simulations in batch mode using -b option. In batch mode you can also define the number of runs using different run indexes. For example:\r\n\r\n    ./one.sh -b 22 example_settings/snw_comparison_settings.txt \r\n\r\nThat would run Spray and Wait comparison using 11 different message copy counts and with binary and normal mode. See Settings class' javadoc for details about run indexing.\r\n\r\nTo create a local copy of the javadoc documentation, run the `create_docs.sh` script in the doc folder.\r\n\r\nSee the project [README](https://github.com/akeranen/the-one/wiki/README) for more information.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Publications\r\n\r\nMichael Solomon Desta, Ari Keränen, Teemu Kärkkäinen, Esa Hyytiä, Jörg Ott: Evaluating (Geo) Content Sharing with the ONE Simulator.
