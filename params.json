{"name":"The ONE","tagline":"The Opportunistic Network Environment simulator","body":"### Information\r\n\r\nThe ONE is a simulation environment that is capable of\r\n\r\n* generating node movement using different movement models\r\n* routing messages between nodes with various DTN routing algorithms and sender and receiver types\r\n* visualizing both mobility and message passing in real time in its graphical user interface.\r\n* ONE can import mobility data from real-world traces or other mobility generators. It can also produce a variety of reports from node movement to message passing and general statistics.\r\n\r\n### Referring to the ONE simulator\r\n\r\nIf you have used the ONE simulator in your research, please use the SIMUTools paper ([[PDF]](https://www.netlab.tkk.fi/tutkimus/dtn/theone/pub/the_one_simutools.pdf) [[BibTeX]](https://www.netlab.tkk.fi/tutkimus/dtn/theone/pub/theone_bib.txt)) as the reference.\r\n\r\n### Community Resources\r\n\r\nThe users of the ONE simulator have created many helpful resources:\r\n\r\n* [Barun Saha's Knowledge Base for the ONE](https://theonekb-barunsaha.rhcloud.com/)\r\n* [The ONE Simulator for Beginners](http://one-simuator-for-beginners.blogspot.in/2013/08/one-simulator-introduction.html)\r\n* [ONE Tutorial by Mauro Margalho Coutinho](http://www.margalho.pro.br/subsites/theone.html)\r\n* [Agussalim's metrics compilation](http://agoes.web.id/metric-description-from-simulator/)\r\n* [Barun Saha's blog on Delay-tolerant Networks](http://delay-tolerant-networks.blogspot.com.br/)\r\n[Sahil Gupta's web site related to DTN and ONE](https://sites.google.com/site/sahilgupta221231/file-cabinet)\r\n\r\n### Contact\r\n\r\nFor questions about the simulator you can subscribe to the ONE user community email list at our [mailman](https://www.netlab.tkk.fi/mailman/listinfo/theone).\r\n\r\nThis list is for discussion and announcements for the ONE simulator. The users of the ONE can report bugs, share experiences and code, and give hints to each other on this list. New releases of the ONE are also announced on this list.\r\n\r\nHowever, we are planning to move to a new platform for Q&A in the near future. Stay tuned, the change will be announced at the mailing list.\r\n\r\n### License\r\n\r\nThe program is released under GPLv3 license. Copyrights of the included map data of Helsinki downtown are owned by Maanmittauslaitos.\r\n\r\n### Running (a really quick help)\r\n\r\nDownload the program. Compile it using your favourite IDE or compile.bat (should work in Linux, Windows and Mac OS X).\r\n\r\nStart a simulation by typing (in Linux/Unix/OS X)\r\n    ./one.sh\r\nor (in Windows)\r\n    one.bat\r\n\r\nAfter a short while, the GUI should start and a simulation should be up and running.\r\n\r\nEvery simulation run uses the settings from default_settings.txt, if one exists. You can give an additional configuration file(s) as a parameters to define new settings or override the ones defined in default settings. For example:\r\n\r\n    ./one.sh epidemic_settings.txt\r\n\r\nThat would use the (included) epidemic settings configuration file and change the router for all nodes to epidemic (default is \"passive router\", i.e., no routing logic). See default_settings.txt for information about the different settings.\r\n\r\nIf you don't wish to use the GUI, you can run simulations in batch mode using -b option. In batch mode you can also define the number of runs using different run indexes. For example:\r\n\r\n    ./one.sh -b 22 example_settings/snw_comparison_settings.txt \r\n\r\nThat would run spray and wait comparison using 11 different message copy counts and with binary and normal mode. See Settings class' javadoc for details about run indexing.\r\n\r\nTo create a local copy of the javadoc documentation, run the create_docs.sh script in the doc folder.\r\n\r\nSee the included README.txt for more information.\r\n\r\n### Publications\r\n\r\nAri Keränen, Jörg Ott and Teemu Kärkkäinen: The ONE Simulator for DTN Protocol Evaluation.
